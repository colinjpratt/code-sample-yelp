Sample Coding Exercise

To get this projec to work you will need to add the api.json file to the root directory of the project

Challenges
- Ive never used the Yelp API
- I was running short on time and took short cuts to get images to display

If I hade more time I would have
- Polished the UI, it needs more work..
- Fixed the way I am loading imaged, I put an extension on UIImageView but ideally i would like to be able to have more control of the image task
- Added suggestions/autofill - Yelp has a nice API for autofill that would be very nice with a UISearchController
- My location manager isnt great either, I dont like how i set it up it depends a lot on timing and could cause problems
- Error handling needs improvment
